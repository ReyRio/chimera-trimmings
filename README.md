# chimera-trimmings

Custom settings and aliases for UCSF Chimera.

Put `chimera_aliases.com` somehere on your system and specify it as a file to read at startup (Favorites...Preferences...Command Line).

Adds a bunch of extra commands of variable utility.

I like `symclip` - to symmetrically clip with respect to the center of rotation, `cootmode` to make a Coot-like density representation for the specified volume, and `cofron` to make moving/rotating more Coot-like, and `centersel`, which moves the center of rotation to the current selection.
